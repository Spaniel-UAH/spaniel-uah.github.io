## Hello! I'm **Spaniel** (*Daniel, if you must*)

I'm a last year student at University of Alcal√° de Henares, Spain, where I study Information Systems Engineering. I'm currently working on my cybersecurity skills and intend to specialize in this field. Other interests include programming, software research and videogame design and development.

### Knowledge
- **Languages**: Java, Python, C, C++, C#, Lua, Bash, SQL (PostgreSQL) and R.
- **Virtualization**: VMWare, VirtualBox, Docker.
- **Networking**: TCP/IP, HTTP/HTTPS, FTP, SSH, blah blah most of the generic protocols, still working on it.
- **Operating Systems**: Windows, Linux (Debian, Ubuntu)
- **Cybersecurity**: Basic knowledge of cybersecurity concepts and tools. Currently learning about defensive security, SOC operations and DFIR.
- **Tools**: Git, Visual Studio Code, Intellij IDEA, Burp Suite, Wireshark, Metasploit, Nmap and OSINT-related tools.
- **Misc**: Not related, but I do like to practice my 3D modeling skills on Blender and I edit videos on DaVinci Resolve. I sometimes fix my friends' computers as well.

### What am I up to?
I'm currently working towards completing the HTB SOC Analyst course, which would be a great help breaking into the cybersecurity field. When I finish my degree, I also intend to pursue a Master's degree in Cybersecurity, and hopefully gather certifications in the process.

### Projects
I currently have no public projects, but I do have some private ones that are either university-related or unfinished. I do not intend to publish my university projects as some might contain sensitive information from my classmates, but if you're a fellow student and need help with something, feel free to reach out as I'd be happy to help.

### Contact
You can contact me through GitHub or via university email `daniel.rubioc (at) edu.uah.es` (this address might be deactivated by the time you're reading this). Socials should be linked below and kept up to date.
I'm aware that there's not much to see here, but if you're interested in a helping hand (or would like to help me), feel free to reach out. I'm open to collaborating on any cybersecurity-related projects, or other software stuff.
