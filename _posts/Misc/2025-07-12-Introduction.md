# Hello, I'm Spaniel!
Welcome to my site! This is a place where I will share my progress, projects, and any interesting stuff I come across as I work towards breaking into cybersecurity.

I will also, if possible, share some of my experiences as well as writedowns on either the courses I'm working on or any CTF or similar that I participate in.

## Who am I?
I'm a student in UAH (University of Alcal√° de Henares, not that Albany one) in Spain, where I study Information Systems Engineering. Aside from that, I'm also into programming and videogames (more playing than developing, but I do dabble in it every now and then). I've also worked on Blender and find it peaceful to model random stuff, mostly hard surface, from time to time.

## What to expect?
Maybe some posts, maybe nothing. I'm not much of a talker (or writer) and I currently don't have much to share, but I will try to keep this updated with any interesting thing I find or do. If any of my friends or colleagues find this, well, don't mention it.

Also, some of the posts might be in Spanish, because I already wrote my notes throughout the years and, with all due respect, don't feel like translating them when I doubt anyone will read them anyway. It's all in markdown anyway so you can just download the files and translate them with copilot if you want to.
